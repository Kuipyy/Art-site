<h3>Origins</h3>
    <p>
        Rococo art emerged in France as a decorative art used in interior design and gardens, but painters began to adopt the style in the early eighteenth century. French royalty and the elite embraced artwork that celebrated love, leisure, and fashion in a way that was light, sumptuous, and even erotic. Rococo paintings decorated rooms in ornate homes of the aristocracy where members of high society would gather for intellectual discussions and entertainment. Though Rococo started in France, its influence quickly spread to artists and architects in England, Italy, and Germany.

<h3>Characteristics</h3>
    <p>
        How can you tell whether or not a painting is part of the Rococo movement? Rococo artists used loose brush strokes, pastel colors, and flowing lines and forms in their compositions, regardless of a painting's subject matter. Many Rococo paintings are asymmetrical, meaning the design or overall composition is off-center. Each of these elements helps to create a sense of motion and playfulness within a painting.

        Rococo artists often painted mythological scenes set in utopian landscapes, portraits, and depictions of love. The first Rococo painter, Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721), was responsible for the creation of a new type of artistic category called amorous festival paintings, or fête galante. Fête galante paintings are depictions of aristocrats enjoying various forms of outdoor recreation in the countryside.
        
        Today, we find entertainment through television or movies. In a similar way, those who commissioned Rococo paintings wanted their artworks to be visual escapes that would help viewers forget about the mundane in life and celebrate leisure and pleasure.
