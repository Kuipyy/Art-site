<h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>
        The Realism art period was a stylistic and social movement that began in France in the mid-nineteenth century. The Realism movement rejected the artistic approach of the Romantic period that had preceded it, which glorified nature and heroic figures. Before Realism, painting and sculpture had been concerned with rendering Biblical and mythological figures that exalted the best of humanity. Human figures were presented as Classical Greek ideals, with perfect bodies and beautiful, unblemished faces.

        Realism artists, on the other hand, began to paint human subjects as they really existed in all their flaws, suffering, and imperfections. They wanted to hold up “regular” people as worthy of artistic representation. The Realism movement grew out of the 1848 Revolution in France that established people’s “right to work” and focused on worker’s rights. In this way, it was as much a political as an aesthetic movement.
